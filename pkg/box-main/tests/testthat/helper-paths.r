#' Compute normalized logical paths

#' \code{realpath(path)} will return the normalized logical path for

#' nonexistent paths on Unix systems.
#' @param path a character vector of paths
#' @note This function doesnâ€™t work with paths containing newlines; this is a
#' restriction of R because it truncates nul characters and thus cannot pass
#' the \code{-z} flag to the \code{realpath} shell function.

#' Replacement for \code{normalizePath} that works with non-existent paths on
#' Unix
#'
#' @param path vector of paths to normalize.
#' @details
#' \code{normalize_path} works like \code{\link[base]{normalizePath}}, but also
#' works on non-existent paths. \code{\link[base]{normalizePath}} has an option
#' \code{mustWork = FALSE} for this; however, that option only works on Windows.
#' On Unix systems, it causes paths to be left untouched. However, and as a
#' consequence, \code{normalize_path} does \emph{not} resolve symlinks.
